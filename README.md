# SENG 265-Software Development Methods
Completed projects from SENG 265.
## Projects
## A1: Calendar Scheduler in C with Basic Data Structures
Project written in C that reads in line of data from xml files, passes in dates and filename as arguments from the command line, and then print the calendar event in chrnological order.
## A2: Calendar Scheduler in Python
Project written in Python that reads in line of data from xml files, passes in dates and filenames as arguments from the command line, and then print the calendar event in chrnological order.
## A3: Calendar Scheduler in C with understanding of C memory allocation and advanced Data Structures such as Struct and Linked-list
Project written in C by leveraging linked-list and Struct to efficiently read in event data and append each calendar event in proper order. Makefile is used during the build process during code compilation.
## A4: Art Generator
Project written in Python that utilizes custom shape classes (Circle, Rectangle, Ellipse) and custom functions to automate shape generation with various sizes. The shape is displayed in the form of HTML-SVG pages with the use of object-oriented-programming principle while leveraging function decomposition with the use of data structure and algorithm.
